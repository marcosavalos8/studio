# Task Dialog Fix - Async/Await Issue

## Problem Statement
The task addition dialog was not working correctly. When users attempted to add a new task:
- The dialog would not respond
- No error messages were displayed
- The dialog would not close
- Tasks were not being added to the database

## Root Cause
The issue was in the form submission handlers in both `add-task-dialog.tsx` and `edit-task-dialog.tsx`.

The Firestore operations (`addDoc` and `updateDoc`) were being called without the `await` keyword:

```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE - Incorrect
addDoc(tasksCollection, newTask)
  .then(() => {
    // Success handling
  })
  .catch(() => {
    // Error handling  
  })
```

This caused the async function to return immediately before the Firestore operation completed. When the operation failed (e.g., due to permissions or network issues), the error handler would emit an event but not provide any user feedback, leaving the dialog hanging.

## Solution
Convert the promise chain to proper async/await with try/catch:

```javascript
// ✅ AFTER - Correct
try {
  await addDoc(tasksCollection, newTask);
  // Success handling
} catch (error) {
  // Error handling
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. `add-task-dialog.tsx`
- Changed `addDoc()` promise chain to async/await
- Form now properly waits for Firestore operation to complete
- Error handling is now synchronous

### 2. `edit-task-dialog.tsx`
- Changed `updateDoc()` promise chain to async/await
- Form now properly waits for Firestore operation to complete
- Error handling is now synchronous

## Impact

### Before Fix
1. User clicks "Add Task"
2. Form submits
3. `onSubmit` function returns immediately (not waiting for Firestore)
4. React Hook Form thinks submission is complete
5. If Firestore operation fails, dialog hangs with no feedback

### After Fix
1. User clicks "Add Task"
2. Form submits
3. `onSubmit` function **awaits** Firestore operation
4. If successful: toast shown, form reset, dialog closes
5. If failed: error is emitted, form stays in submitting state until promise resolves
6. React Hook Form properly manages the submission state throughout

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test adding a new task with valid data
2. Test adding a task with missing required fields (should show validation errors)
3. Test with poor network connectivity
4. Test with insufficient Firestore permissions
5. Test editing an existing task
6. Verify dialog closes after successful submission
7. Verify appropriate feedback is shown to users

## Future Improvements
Consider adding explicit error toast messages in the catch blocks to provide better user feedback when operations fail:

```javascript
} catch (error) {
  toast({
    variant: 'destructive',
    title: 'Error',
    description: 'Failed to add task. Please try again.',
  })
  // Also emit permission error for debugging
  errorEmitter.emit('permission-error', permissionError);
}
```
