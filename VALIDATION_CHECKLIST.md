## Notes for Testers

### Common Issues to Watch For:
1. **QR Scanner Not Working**: May need browser camera permissions
2. **Validation Errors**: Check that all required fields are filled
3. **Date Issues**: Ensure correct timezone handling
4. **Task Selection**: Make sure task is selected before operations

### Test Data Suggestions:
- Create at least 2 test employees with QR codes
- Create at least 2 test tasks (1 hourly, 1 piecework)
- Create at least 1 test client
- Use consistent naming for easy tracking

### Expected Behavior:
- All previous functionality should work exactly as before
- New Piece-Work tab should feel natural and intuitive
- Task creation should be less confusing with conditional fields
- Payroll calculations should remain accurate

### Success Criteria:
✅ No functionality lost
✅ New piecework workflow is clear and efficient
✅ Task management is simplified
✅ Data integrity maintained
✅ Payroll calculations accurate
✅ No performance degradation
✅ Responsive on all devices
✅ Accessible to all users
