# Piece-Work Tab Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the new Piece-Work tab and task simplification as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Time-Tracking Page Updates

#### New Tab Structure
- **Added 4th main tab**: "Piece-Work" alongside QR Scanner, Manual Entry, and History
- **Tab Layout**: Changed from 3-column to 4-column grid

#### QR Scanner Tab (Clock In/Out Only)
- **Removed**: Piecework scan mode option
- **Kept**: Clock-in and Clock-out modes only
- **Simplified**: 2-column layout instead of 3

#### Manual Entry Tab (Clock In/Out Only)
- **Removed**: Piecework log type option
- **Kept**: Clock-in and Clock-out log types only
- **Maintained**: Bulk Clock In, Bulk Clock Out, and Log Sick Leave sections

#### New Piece-Work Tab (Two Sub-Tabs)

##### Sub-Tab 1: QR Code Scanner (Piecework)
- **Selection Fields**: Client, Ranch, Block, Task (same as main tabs)
- **Manual Date/Time**: Optional checkbox to set custom timestamp
- **Shared Piece**: Switch to enable multiple workers per piece
- **Entry Mode**: Radio buttons for "Scan Bins" or "Manual Count"
- **Functionality**:
  - Scan employee QR codes to add them to the list
  - Scan bin QR codes to record piecework
  - Manual count option for entering quantity without scanning bins
  - Shows list of scanned employees before recording
  - Saves to `piecework` collection with all metadata

##### Sub-Tab 2: Manual Log Entry (Piecework)
- **Selection Fields**: Client, Ranch, Block, Task
- **Manual Date/Time**: Optional checkbox to set custom timestamp
- **Employee Search**: Searchable employee selector
- **Quantity Input**: Number field for pieces/bins
- **Notes**: Optional textarea for QC notes or other details
- **Submit**: Records piecework directly to database
- **Not Included**: Bulk Clock In/Out, Log Sick Leave (as requested)

### 2. Task Management Updates

#### Task Creation/Edit Form Simplification
- **Rate Type Field**: Dropdown with "Hourly" or "Piecework" options
- **Conditional Fields**:
  - When "Hourly" selected: Shows "Hourly Rate ($)" field
  - When "Piecework" selected: Shows "Piece Price ($)" field
- **Validation**: Piece price is required when rate type is Piecework
- **Removed Confusion**: Eliminated the dual "Client Rate" and "Piece Price" fields

#### Task Display
- **Rate Column**: Shows appropriate rate based on type
  - Hourly tasks: "$25.00/hr - Hourly"
  - Piecework tasks: "$0.50/piece - Piecework"
- **Safe Display**: Handles missing clientRate with fallback to '0.00'

### 3. Data Structure Compatibility

#### Piecework Records
All piecework entries store:
- `employeeId`: Single or comma-separated IDs for shared pieces
- `taskId`: Reference to the task
- `timestamp`: Date/time of piecework (auto or manual)
- `pieceCount`: Number of pieces/bins
- `pieceQrCode`: QR code of bin or "manual_entry"
- `qcNote`: Optional notes

#### Task Records
Tasks now properly store:
- `clientRateType`: "hourly" or "piece"
- `clientRate`: Used for hourly tasks
- `piecePrice`: Used for piecework tasks (required when type is "piece")

#### Payroll Compatibility
The payroll calculation system already:
- Reads from `piecework` collection
- Uses `task.piecePrice` to calculate earnings
- Handles both hourly and piecework earnings correctly
- Applies minimum wage adjustments as needed

## Key Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Clock-in/out operations are now separate from piecework tracking
2. **Reduced Confusion**: Task forms no longer show confusing dual rate fields
3. **Better UX**: Dedicated piecework tab makes the workflow clearer
4. **Maintained Flexibility**: All original functionality preserved, just reorganized
5. **Data Integrity**: All records properly stored for accurate payroll calculations

## Testing Recommendations

### Functional Testing
1. **QR Piecework Scanner**:
   - Test scanning employee QR codes
   - Test scanning bin QR codes
   - Test shared piece mode with multiple employees
   - Test manual count mode
   - Test manual date/time selection

2. **Manual Piecework Entry**:
   - Test employee search and selection
   - Test quantity input
   - Test notes field
   - Test manual date/time selection
   - Verify submission saves correctly

3. **Task Management**:
   - Create new hourly task (verify only hourly rate shown)
   - Create new piecework task (verify only piece price shown)
   - Edit existing tasks (verify correct fields shown)
   - Verify validation (piece price required for piecework)

4. **Regular Clock-In/Out**:
   - Verify QR Scanner still works for clock-in/out
   - Verify Manual Entry still works for clock-in/out
   - Verify bulk operations still work
   - Verify sick leave logging still works

5. **Data Verification**:
   - Check piecework records in Firestore
   - Verify task records have correct rate types
   - Test payroll calculation with new data structure

### Integration Testing
1. Run a complete workflow:
   - Create piecework task with piece price
   - Record piecework using QR scanner
   - Record piecework using manual entry
   - Generate payroll report
   - Verify earnings calculated correctly

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/(app)/time-tracking/page.tsx`
   - Added new Piece-Work tab with two sub-tabs
   - Removed piecework mode from QR Scanner
   - Removed piecework from Manual Entry
   - Added `handlePieceworkScanResult` callback

2. `/src/app/(app)/tasks/add-task-dialog.tsx`
   - Updated schema with validation
   - Conditional rate field display based on type
   - Simplified form layout

3. `/src/app/(app)/tasks/edit-task-dialog.tsx`
   - Updated schema with validation
   - Conditional rate field display based on type
   - Simplified form layout

4. `/src/app/(app)/tasks/page.tsx`
   - Updated rate display in table
   - Safe handling of missing clientRate

## Notes for Developers

- The `scanMode` state is still used for the main QR Scanner tab
- Piecework scanning uses a separate handler: `handlePieceworkScanResult`
- All existing state management (dates, employees, quantities) is reused
- No changes needed to Firestore schema or payroll calculations
- All validation and error handling preserved
