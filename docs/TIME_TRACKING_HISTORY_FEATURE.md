# Time Tracking History Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the Time Tracking page's History tab to provide comprehensive record management capabilities, including viewing all historical data, filtering by date range, and deleting individual records.

## Features

### 1. Complete History View
- **All Time Entries**: Displays ALL clock-in/clock-out records, not just currently active ones
- **All Piecework Records**: Shows complete piecework history with full details
- **Separate Sections**: Organized into two distinct sections for better clarity

### 2. Date Range Filtering
- **Start Date Filter**: Filter records from a specific start date
- **End Date Filter**: Filter records up to a specific end date
- **Clear Filters Button**: Quickly remove all date filters to view all records
- **Real-time Updates**: Filters apply immediately as Firestore queries update

### 3. Record Management
- **Delete Time Entries**: Remove individual clock-in/clock-out records
- **Delete Piecework**: Remove individual piecework records
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Safety mechanism to prevent accidental deletions
- **Success/Error Feedback**: Toast notifications confirm operations

## User Interface

### Time Entry Display
Each time entry shows:
- Employee name
- Task name and variety
- Client name
- Clock-in timestamp (formatted as "PPp" - e.g., "Jan 15, 2025, 2:30 PM")
- Clock-out timestamp (if available)
- Active badge (green) for entries without clock-out
- Delete button (red trash icon)

### Piecework Display
Each piecework record shows:
- Employee name(s) (supports multiple employees)
- Task name and variety
- Client name
- Timestamp
- Piece quantity
- Bin QR code (if scanned)
- Manual entry badge (blue) for manual entries
- QC notes (if provided)
- Delete button (red trash icon)

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Date filtering
const [historyStartDate, setHistoryStartDate] = useState<Date | undefined>(undefined);
const [historyEndDate, setHistoryEndDate] = useState<Date | undefined>(undefined);

// Delete confirmation
const [deleteConfirmOpen, setDeleteConfirmOpen] = useState(false);
const [deleteTarget, setDeleteTarget] = useState<{type: 'time' | 'piecework', id: string} | null>(null);
```

### Firestore Queries
The feature uses dynamic Firestore queries that update based on date filters:

```typescript
// Time entries query with optional date constraints
const allTimeEntriesQuery = useMemo(() => {
  if (!firestore) return null;
  const constraints = [];
  if (historyStartDate) {
    constraints.push(where("timestamp", ">=", startOfDay(historyStartDate)));
  }
  if (historyEndDate) {
    constraints.push(where("timestamp", "<=", endOfDay(historyEndDate)));
  }
  return constraints.length > 0 
    ? query(collection(firestore, "time_entries"), ...constraints) 
    : query(collection(firestore, "time_entries"));
}, [firestore, historyStartDate, historyEndDate]);

// Similar pattern for piecework query
```

### Delete Operations
Both time entries and piecework records can be deleted through a confirmation dialog:

1. User clicks delete button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms deletion
4. Record is deleted from Firestore
5. Success/error toast notification appears
6. UI updates automatically through Firestore listeners

## Usage

### Viewing History
1. Navigate to Time Tracking page
2. Click on the "History" tab
3. View all clock-in/clock-out records and piecework entries

### Filtering by Date
1. In the History tab, locate the "Filter by Date Range" section
2. Select a start date, end date, or both
3. Records are automatically filtered
4. Click "Clear Filters" to remove date constraints

### Deleting Records
1. Find the record you want to delete
2. Click the red trash icon button
3. A confirmation dialog appears
4. Click "Delete" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort
5. Record is permanently removed from the database

## Security Considerations

- **Firestore Rules**: Ensure your Firestore security rules allow authenticated users to delete records
- **Permission Errors**: The app handles permission errors gracefully and notifies users
- **Confirmation Required**: All deletions require user confirmation to prevent accidents

## Benefits

1. **Error Correction**: Users can delete mistaken entries that would otherwise appear in reports
2. **Data Management**: Full visibility into historical records for auditing and correction
3. **Flexible Filtering**: Date range filtering helps users find specific records quickly
4. **User Safety**: Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental data loss
5. **Real-time Updates**: Firestore listeners ensure the UI always shows current data

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Bulk delete operations
- Edit functionality for existing records
- Export filtered records to CSV
- Advanced filtering (by employee, task, client)
- Pagination for large datasets
- Search functionality
