# Past Entry Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of improvements to the Time Tracking system based on client requirements.

## Requirements Addressed

### 1. Past Entry Mode ✅
**Requirement:** Add an option for efficiently entering past records with both clock-in and clock-out times in a single submission, including the ability to enter pieces worked.

**Implementation:**
- Added new "Past Entry" log type to the Manual Entry tab
- When selected:
  - Automatically enables manual date/time selection
  - Hides the regular log type dropdown (replaced with dedicated Past Entry UI)
  - Shows two date/time pickers: one for Clock-In and one for Clock-Out
  - Includes a Pieces Worked field (optional, supports decimals)
  - Creates complete time entry with both timestamps in one action
  - Automatically creates corresponding piecework records when pieces are entered

**Benefits:**
- Saves time when entering historical records
- No need to do separate Clock-In and Clock-Out actions
- Can record pieces worked at the same time
- Reduces errors by validating that clock-out is after clock-in

### 2. Decimal Support for Pieces ✅
**Requirement:** Allow decimal values when editing pieces in the History tab.

**Implementation:**
- Updated all pieces input fields to support decimal values:
  - Past Entry pieces field: `step="0.01"`
  - Time Entry edit dialog pieces field: `step="0.01"` with `parseFloat`
  - Piecework edit dialog: Already supported decimals
- Changed parsing from `parseInt` to `parseFloat` for piece counts
- Updated labels to indicate decimal support

**Benefits:**
- Allows for fractional piece counts (e.g., 7.5 pieces)
- More accurate tracking of work done
- Consistent with real-world scenarios where partial pieces occur

### 3. Simplified History Tab ✅
**Requirement:** Remove the separate "Piecework Records" section and keep only "Clock-In/Clock-Out Records" that shows all information including pieces.

**Implementation:**
- Removed the entire "Piecework Records" section (lines 3197-3337)
- Enhanced "Clock-In/Clock-Out Records" section to display:
  - Payment modality badge (Hourly or Piecework)
  - Pieces worked when available
  - All existing information (employee, task, client, timestamps)
- Edit functionality remains accessible from time entries
- Edit dialog allows changing:
  - Task and client information
  - Clock-in and clock-out times
  - Pieces worked
  - Payment modality

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for all time tracking records
- Less confusing for users
- All information visible in one place
- Simplified navigation

## Technical Details

### New State Variables
```typescript
const [pastEntryPieces, setPastEntryPieces] = useState<number | string>(0);
```

### Updated Types
```typescript
type ManualLogType =
  | "clock-in"
  | "clock-out"
  | "start-break"
  | "end-break"
  | "piecework"
  | "past-entry";  // NEW
```

### Key Functions Modified

#### handleManualSubmit
- Added `past-entry` handling
- Validates both clock-in and clock-out dates are provided
- Validates clock-out is after clock-in
- Creates complete time entry with both timestamps
- Automatically determines payment modality based on pieces entered
- Creates piecework records when pieces are provided for piecework tasks

#### UI Components
- Past Entry Mode indicator with amber styling
- Two DateTimePicker components for clock-in and clock-out
- Pieces input field with decimal support
- Switch button to return to regular entry mode

## User Workflow

### Creating a Past Entry
1. Navigate to Time Tracking → Manual Entry tab
2. Select Client, Ranch, Block, and Task
3. Select "Past Entry" from Log Type dropdown
4. Manual Date/Time is automatically enabled
5. Enter Clock-In Date & Time
6. Enter Clock-Out Date & Time
7. Optionally enter Pieces Worked (supports decimals)
8. Search and select Employee
9. Click "Submit Log"
10. System validates dates and creates:
    - Time entry with both timestamps
    - Piecework records (if pieces were entered and task is piecework)

### Viewing Records in History
1. Navigate to Time Tracking → History tab
2. View all records in "Clock-In/Clock-Out Records" section
3. Each record shows:
   - Employee name
   - Active status (if still clocked in)
   - Payment type badge (Hourly/Piecework)
   - Task and client information
   - Clock-in and clock-out times
   - Pieces worked (if applicable)
4. Click Edit to modify any record
5. Can change task, times, pieces, and payment modality

## Files Modified

- `/src/app/(app)/time-tracking/page.tsx`
  - Added `past-entry` to ManualLogType
  - Added pastEntryPieces state
  - Updated handleManualSubmit with past-entry logic
  - Added UI components for past entry form
  - Enhanced history display with pieces
  - Removed Piecework Records section
  - Updated pieces fields to support decimals

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Past Entry Creation**
   - Create past entry with only time (no pieces)
   - Create past entry with pieces for piecework task
   - Create past entry with pieces for hourly task
   - Verify validation prevents clock-out before clock-in
   - Verify validation requires both dates

2. **Decimal Support**
   - Enter decimal pieces in past entry (e.g., 7.5)
   - Edit existing record with decimal pieces
   - Verify decimals display correctly in history

3. **History Display**
   - Verify all time entries show in Clock-In/Clock-Out Records
   - Verify pieces display when present
   - Verify payment modality badge shows correctly
   - Verify edit functionality works for all entry types

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Past entry without pieces for piecework task
   - Past entry with pieces for hourly task
   - Switching between log types
   - Date/time validation
