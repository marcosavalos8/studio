# Payroll Calculation Fix - Hourly Tasks

## Issue Description

After implementing the piecework tab and task simplification, the payroll calculation was showing $0 in raw earnings for hourly tasks, even though the employee worked hours for that task.

### Example from Client:
- **Task**: "Supervision (general)" - Hourly type with $25/hr rate
- **Hours worked**: 3.00 hours
- **Expected earnings**: $75.00 (3 × $25)
- **Actual earnings**: $0.00 ❌

Meanwhile, piecework tasks were calculating correctly:
- **Task**: "Apple picking (Kanzi)" - Piecework type with $25/piece rate
- **Pieces**: 7
- **Earnings**: $175.00 (7 × $25) ✅

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps

1. **Task Creation Verification** ✅
   - Checked task forms are saving `clientRateType` correctly
   - Verified both "hourly" and "piece" values are stored in Firestore
   - Confirmed `clientRate` field is saved for hourly tasks

2. **Data Retrieval Verification** ✅
   - Confirmed tasks load with correct `clientRateType` from Firestore
   - Verified `clientRate` value is present in task data
   - Checked payroll report receives correct task information

3. **Payroll Calculation Issue** ❌
   - **Found the bug**: Code was only calculating earnings for piecework tasks
   - Hourly tasks had hours tracked but earnings were not calculated
   - The code had a comment saying "will be adjusted to minimum wage" but no actual calculation

### Code Analysis

**Before Fix** (lines 279-305 in `generate-payroll-report.ts`):
```typescript
// Calculate earnings based on pieces if piecePrice is set
if (pieces > 0 && task.piecePrice && task.piecePrice > 0) {
  earningsForTask = pieces * task.piecePrice;
  // ...
  weeklyTotalPieceworkEarnings += earningsForTask;
} else if (hours > 0) {
  // For hourly work, earnings will be calculated based on minimum wage
  // The minimum wage adjustment will be applied later
  console.log("Hourly work (will be adjusted to minimum wage):", {
    taskName: task.name,
    hours,
  });
  // ❌ NO CALCULATION HERE - earnings remained 0
}
```

The problem:
- Piecework tasks: Calculated `earningsForTask = pieces × piecePrice` ✅
- Hourly tasks: Only logged to console, `earningsForTask` stayed 0 ❌

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made (Commit d6a13e0)

Updated the payroll calculation logic to properly handle both task types:

```typescript
// Calculate earnings based on task type and rate
if (task.clientRateType === 'piece' && pieces > 0 && task.piecePrice && task.piecePrice > 0) {
  // Piecework task: calculate based on pieces
  earningsForTask = pieces * task.piecePrice;
  console.log("Calculated piecework earnings:", {
    taskName: task.name,
    pieces,
    piecePrice: task.piecePrice,
    earnings: earningsForTask,
  });
  weeklyTotalPieceworkEarnings += earningsForTask;
  
} else if (task.clientRateType === 'hourly' && hours > 0) {
  // Hourly task: calculate based on hours and clientRate
  earningsForTask = hours * (task.clientRate || 0);
  console.log("Calculated hourly earnings:", {
    taskName: task.name,
    hours,
    clientRate: task.clientRate,
    earnings: earningsForTask,
  });
  
} else if (hours > 0) {
  // Fallback for tasks without explicit type (backward compatibility)
  if (pieces > 0 && task.piecePrice && task.piecePrice > 0) {
    earningsForTask = pieces * task.piecePrice;
    weeklyTotalPieceworkEarnings += earningsForTask;
  } else {
    earningsForTask = hours * (task.clientRate || 0);
  }
  console.log("Calculated earnings (fallback):", { ... });
}
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Type-Based Calculation**: Uses `task.clientRateType` to determine calculation method
2. **Hourly Formula**: `earningsForTask = hours × clientRate`
3. **Piecework Formula**: `earningsForTask = pieces × piecePrice`
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Handles old tasks without explicit `clientRateType`
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging information including task type and rates

## Expected Results

After the fix, payroll calculations should work correctly for both task types:

### Piecework Task Example
```
Task: Apple picking (Kanzi)
Type: Piecework
Rate: $25.00/piece
Pieces: 7
Raw Earnings: 7 × $25 = $175.00 ✅
```

### Hourly Task Example
```
Task: Supervision (general)
Type: Hourly
Rate: $25.00/hr
Hours: 3.00
Raw Earnings: 3 × $25 = $75.00 ✅ (FIXED)
```

### Minimum Wage Adjustment
The existing minimum wage adjustment logic remains unchanged:
- Daily minimum: `max(rawEarnings, hours × minimumWage)`
- Weekly comparison: Applied after all task earnings calculated
- Works correctly for both hourly and piecework tasks

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Hourly Task
1. Create a task with Rate Type = "Hourly", Hourly Rate = $25
2. Log 3 hours of work for an employee on this task
3. Generate payroll report
4. Verify Raw Earnings shows $75.00 (not $0.00)

### Test Case 2: Piecework Task
1. Create a task with Rate Type = "Piecework", Piece Price = $0.50
2. Log 100 pieces for an employee on this task
3. Generate payroll report
4. Verify Raw Earnings shows $50.00

### Test Case 3: Mixed Tasks
1. Employee works 5 hours on hourly task ($20/hr)
2. Same employee collects 50 pieces on piecework task ($1/piece)
3. Generate payroll report
4. Verify:
   - Hourly task: $100.00
   - Piecework task: $50.00
   - Total raw earnings: $150.00

### Test Case 4: Minimum Wage Adjustment
1. Employee works 8 hours on hourly task ($10/hr = $80)
2. State minimum wage is $16.28 (8 × $16.28 = $130.24)
3. Verify final earnings adjusted to $130.24

## Business Logic Clarification

The payroll system now correctly implements:

1. **Client pays for tasks** (hourly or piecework rates)
2. **Employee earnings calculation**:
   - Piecework: `pieces × piecePrice`
   - Hourly: `hours × clientRate`
3. **Minimum wage protection**:
   - Daily: `max(taskEarnings, hours × minimumWage)`
   - Weekly: Additional comparison per WAC 296-126-021
4. **Payment determination**:
   - If piecework earnings > minimum wage → Pay piecework rate
   - If piecework earnings < minimum wage → Pay minimum wage
   - Hourly tasks also get minimum wage protection
