# Time Tracking Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Loading State for Hourly Tasks with Past Records
**Problem**: When using "Use Manual Date/Time for Past Records" for hourly tasks, the submit button would get stuck in the loading state.

**Solution**: Wrapped the `handleManualSubmit` function's async operations in a `try-finally` block to ensure `setIsManualSubmitting(false)` is always called, even if an error occurs.

**Changes**:
- Modified `handleManualSubmit` function (lines ~1151-1191)
- Added try-finally block to guarantee loading state reset

### Issue 2: Simplified Past Records UI
**Problem**: The "Use Manual Date/Time for Past Records" feature had redundant date selection - two full DateTimePicker components (one for clock-in and one for clock-out) which required selecting the date twice.

**Solution**: Replaced the two DateTimePicker components with:
1. **One date picker** for selecting the day (calendar only)
2. **Two time inputs** for start and end times

This makes the UI more intuitive and less redundant, as users typically record past work for the same day.

**Changes**:
- Added new imports: `Calendar as CalendarComponent`, `Popover`, `PopoverContent`, `PopoverTrigger`, and `cn` utility
- Replaced two `DateTimePicker` components with a custom date/time picker UI (lines ~2111-2211)
- Date picker preserves existing times when changing dates (defaults to 08:00 for start, 17:00 for end)
- Time inputs automatically create Date objects based on the selected date

### Issue 3: Keyboard Input for Piecework Quantity in Edit Dialog
**Problem**: When editing piecework tasks in the History tab, the pieces input field wouldn't allow keyboard input - it would always show 0 due to an aggressive `onBlur` handler.

**Solution**: Removed the `onBlur` handler that was automatically converting empty strings to 0, and improved the `onChange` handler to be more user-friendly.

**Changes**:
- Removed `onBlur` handler from the main pieces input field (line ~3809-3813 removed)
- Improved `onChange` handlers for related piecework fields to properly handle empty strings (lines ~3933-3947)

### Issue 4: Hide "Pieces Worked" Section for Hourly Tasks
**Problem**: When editing hourly tasks in the History tab, the "Pieces Worked" section would appear even though hourly tasks don't track pieces.

**Solution**: Added a check to only show the "Pieces Worked" section when the selected task is a piecework task (`clientRateType === 'piece'`).

**Changes**:
- Modified the condition for showing the pieces section (lines ~3885-3889)
- Added task type check: `const editTask = allTasks?.find(t => t.id === editTaskId); const isPieceworkTask = editTask?.clientRateType === 'piece';`
- Only shows pieces section when `isPieceworkTask` is true

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Past Records for Hourly Tasks**:
   - Go to Manual Entry tab
   - Enable "Use Manual Date/Time for Past Records"
   - Select an hourly task
   - Select a date, start time, and end time
   - Submit and verify it completes successfully without getting stuck

2. **Test Simplified Past Records UI**:
   - Check that only one date needs to be selected
   - Verify start and end times can be set independently
   - Confirm that changing the date preserves the times
   - Test with both piecework and hourly tasks

3. **Test Piecework Editing**:
   - Go to History tab
   - Edit a piecework task
   - Try to modify the piece count
   - Verify you can type numbers freely without the field resetting to 0

4. **Test Hourly Task Editing**:
   - Go to History tab  
   - Edit an hourly task
   - Verify the "Pieces Worked" section does not appear
   - Edit a piecework task
   - Verify the "Pieces Worked" section DOES appear

## Code Quality

- All changes maintain existing code style
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Improved error handling with try-finally blocks
- Better user experience with simplified UI
