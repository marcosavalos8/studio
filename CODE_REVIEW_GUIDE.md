# Code Review Guide - Piecework and Payroll Improvements

## Quick Summary
This PR implements 4 key improvements to the piecework tracking and payroll system:
1. ‚úÖ Filter piecework tasks in piece-work tabs
2. ‚úÖ Individual timestamps for each piece 
3. ‚úÖ Auto clock-out on task switch
4. ‚úÖ Fix weekly payroll adjustment calculation

**Impact**: ~200 lines of functional code changes, ~400 lines of documentation
**Breaking Changes**: None
**Migration Required**: None

## Code Changes to Review

### 1. Task Filtering Enhancement
**File**: `src/app/(app)/time-tracking/page.tsx`

#### Change Location: Lines 1524-1603
```typescript
// BEFORE: Component didn't filter tasks
const SelectionFields = ({ isManual = false }) => (
  // ... rendered filteredTasks directly
)

// AFTER: Component can filter piecework tasks
const SelectionFields = ({ isManual = false, filterPiecework = false }) => {
  const displayTasks = filterPiecework 
    ? filteredTasks.filter(t => t.clientRateType === 'piece')
    : filteredTasks;
  // ... uses displayTasks
}
```

#### Key Points:
- ‚úÖ Backwards compatible (default filterPiecework=false)
- ‚úÖ Simple filter logic
- ‚úÖ Adds visual indicators to ALL tasks (not just filtered ones)

#### Applied At:
- Line 2273: QR Scanner piecework tab
- Line 2435: Manual Entry piecework tab

---

### 2. Individual Piecework Timestamps
**File**: `src/app/(app)/time-tracking/page.tsx`

#### Change Location A: Lines 2576-2640 (Manual Entry Button)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Single record with pieceCount
const newPiecework = {
  pieceCount: pieceCount, // Could be 5
  timestamp: new Date(),
  // ...
};
await addDoc(collection(firestore, "piecework"), newPiecework);

// AFTER: Individual records
for (let i = 0; i < pieceCount; i++) {
  const pieceTimestamp = new Date(baseTimestamp.getTime() + (i * 1000));
  const newPiecework = {
    pieceCount: 1, // Always 1
    timestamp: pieceTimestamp,
    // ...
  };
  await addDoc(collection(firestore, "piecework"), newPiecework);
}
```

#### Change Location B: Lines 988-1026 (QR Manual Count)
Similar loop structure for creating individual records.

#### Key Points:
- ‚úÖ Creates N records for N pieces
- ‚úÖ Timestamps increment by 1 second for ordering
- ‚úÖ pieceCount always = 1 for new entries
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance: N sequential writes (acceptable for typical quantities)

---

### 3. Auto Clock-Out Feature
**File**: `src/app/(app)/time-tracking/page.tsx`

#### Change Location: Lines 532-576
```typescript
// BEFORE: Closed active entries (same as after)
const clockInEmployee = useCallback(async (employee, taskId, ...) => {
  // ... closes active entries ...
  // ... creates new entry ...
  toast({ description: `Clocked in ${employee.name}` });
}, [firestore, toast, playSound]);

// AFTER: Added notification + task type awareness
const clockInEmployee = useCallback(async (employee, taskId, ...) => {
  // ... closes active entries ...
  // ... creates new entry ...
  let description = `Clocked in ${employee.name}`;
  if (activeEntriesSnap.size > 0) {
    description += ` Previous task(s) automatically clocked out.`;
  }
  toast({ description });
}, [firestore, toast, playSound, allTasks]); // Added allTasks dependency
```

#### Key Points:
- ‚úÖ Improves existing auto-close behavior
- ‚úÖ Adds user notification
- ‚úÖ Works for all task type combinations
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes

---

### 4. Payroll Calculation Fix
**File**: `src/ai/flows/generate-payroll-report.ts`

#### Change Location: Lines 241-419

#### BEFORE Logic (Incorrect):
```typescript
// Daily loop
let weeklyTotalPieceworkEarnings = 0;
let weeklyTotalMinimumWageEarnings = 0;

for (const day of days) {
  // Calculate daily earnings
  const dailyMinWage = hours * minWage;
  const dailyAdjusted = max(earnings, dailyMinWage); // ‚ùå Daily adjustment
  
  weeklyTotalPieceworkEarnings += pieceworkEarnings; // Only piecework
  weeklyTotalMinimumWageEarnings += dailyAdjusted; // Includes adjustments
}

// Weekly comparison
const total = max(weeklyTotalPieceworkEarnings, weeklyTotalMinimumWageEarnings);
// ‚ùå PROBLEM: Compares raw piecework vs adjusted totals
```

#### AFTER Logic (Correct):
```typescript
// Daily loop
let weeklyTotalRawEarnings = 0; // All earnings, no adjustments

for (const day of days) {
  // Calculate daily earnings (no minimum wage comparison)
  weeklyTotalRawEarnings += dailyEarnings; // ‚úÖ Raw total
}

// Weekly comparison
const weeklyMinWage = weeklyHours * minWage;
const total = max(weeklyTotalRawEarnings, weeklyMinWage); // ‚úÖ Single comparison
const adjustment = max(0, weeklyMinWage - weeklyTotalRawEarnings);
```

#### Key Points:
- ‚úÖ Single weekly comparison (not daily)
- ‚úÖ Compares all earnings vs minimum wage
- ‚úÖ Prevents overpayment
- ‚úÖ Correct adjustment calculation
- ‚úÖ Maintains same output structure (backwards compatible)

#### Example Scenarios:
```
Scenario 1: Worker exceeds minimum
  40 hours @ $16.28 = $651.20 minimum
  Actual: $500 hourly + $200 piecework = $700
  Adjustment: $0
  Pay: $700 ‚úÖ

Scenario 2: Worker below minimum
  40 hours @ $16.28 = $651.20 minimum
  Actual: $300 hourly + $100 piecework = $400
  Adjustment: $251.20
  Pay: $651.20 ‚úÖ

Scenario 3: Mixed week (was broken before)
  Mon-Wed: $20/hr √ó 24hrs = $480 (exceeds min)
  Thu-Fri: $1/piece √ó 50 = $50 (below min)
  Total: $530 vs $651.20 minimum
  Adjustment: $121.20
  Pay: $651.20 ‚úÖ (was overpaying before)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Testing (No existing test infrastructure)
- ‚ùå No unit tests added (per instructions: skip if no existing tests)

### Manual Testing Required

#### 1. Task Filtering
- [ ] Open Time Tracking ‚Üí Piece-Work ‚Üí QR Scanner
- [ ] Select client with both hourly and piecework tasks
- [ ] Verify only piecework tasks in Task dropdown
- [ ] Verify task labels show üì¶ (piecework) or ‚è∞ (hourly)

#### 2. Individual Timestamps
- [ ] Go to Piece-Work ‚Üí Manual Entry
- [ ] Enter 5 pieces for an employee
- [ ] Check History tab
- [ ] Verify 5 separate records with sequential timestamps (1 sec apart)

#### 3. Auto Clock-Out
- [ ] Clock in employee A to piecework task
- [ ] Clock in employee A to hourly task (without manual clock-out)
- [ ] Verify toast shows "Previous task(s) automatically clocked out"
- [ ] Check History - first task should be closed

#### 4. Payroll
- [ ] Create test data:
  - Week with 40 hours total
  - Mix of hourly and piecework tasks
  - Some days above minimum, some below
- [ ] Generate payroll report
- [ ] Verify adjustment = max(0, weeklyMin - weeklyEarnings)
- [ ] Verify final pay = max(earnings, minimum)

## Security Considerations

### No New Security Concerns
- ‚úÖ No new database permissions required
- ‚úÖ No new external dependencies
- ‚úÖ No authentication/authorization changes
- ‚úÖ Uses existing Firestore security rules

### Existing Security Maintained
- ‚úÖ Same permission checks for piecework writes
- ‚úÖ Same batch write patterns for clock operations
- ‚úÖ Same error handling with FirestorePermissionError

---

## Performance Impact

### Task Filtering
- **Impact**: Negligible (in-memory filter)
- **Benchmark**: O(n) where n = # tasks for client
- **Typical**: 5-20 tasks, <1ms

### Individual Piecework Records
- **Impact**: N sequential writes vs 1 write
- **Benchmark**: ~100ms per write (Firebase RTT)
- **Typical**: 1-10 pieces = 100-1000ms
- **Acceptable**: User already waiting for confirmation
- **Future**: Could optimize with batch writes if needed

### Auto Clock-Out
- **Impact**: None (query already existed)
- **Benefit**: Reduces manual operations

### Payroll Calculation
- **Impact**: Slight improvement (simpler logic)
- **Benchmark**: Same O(n) complexity
- **Benefit**: Fewer calculations per day

## Questions for Review

1. **Timestamp Increment**: Is 1 second sufficient spacing between pieces, or should we use milliseconds?

2. **Batch Writes**: Should we optimize piecework creation with Firestore batch writes for quantities >10?

3. **Task Labels**: Are the emoji indicators (üì¶/‚è∞) appropriate, or should we use text labels?

4. **Payroll Display**: Should we add a breakdown showing raw earnings + adjustment in the payroll UI?

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after merge:

1. **Revert Commit**: `git revert 60d9618` (this PR)
2. **No Data Migration**: Old code handles new data correctly
   - New piecework records (pieceCount=1) work with old code
   - Payroll calculation works with existing data
3. **Manual Fix**: Edit individual piecework records if needed
   - Combine records by summing pieceCount
   - Use earliest timestamp
